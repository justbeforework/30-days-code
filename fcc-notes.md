These are notes I made from freecodecamp.com javascript course

- Comments are ignored

      // this is a single line comment

      /* this is multi-line comment*/
  
- 7 types of javascript data: undefined, null, object, boolean, number, symbol, string

- Variables allow computers to store data.

- Must not start with a number.

- Can initialize a variable to value when it's created:

    var myVar = 'value';
  
- Variables have initial value of 'undefined'.
